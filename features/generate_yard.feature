Feature: Generate yard
  In order to use yard in my ruby project
  As a developer
  I want to generate the yard boilerplate
  
  Background:
    Given a current working directory named "myproject"
  
  Scenario: Run `bddgen yard` in an empty project
    When I run "bddgen yard"
    Then the following files should be created:
      | .gitignore |
    And the file ".gitignore" should contain "doc/*"
    And the file ".gitignore" should contain ".yardoc"
    And the file "Gemfile" should contain exactly:
      """
      source 'http://rubygems.org'
      
      gem 'rake'
      gem 'yard'
      
      """
    And the file "Rakefile" should contain the bundler setup
    And the file "Rakefile" should contain the yard task
    And the exit status should be 0
    
  Scenario: Run `bddgen yard` in a project with an existing .gitignore
    Given a file named ".gitignore" with:
      """
      pkg/*
      tmp/*
      """
    When I run "bddgen yard"
    Then the file ".gitignore" should contain exactly:
      """
      pkg/*
      tmp/*
      doc/*
      .yardoc
      
      """
  
  Scenario: Run `bddgen yard` in a project with an existing Gemfile
    Given a file named "Gemfile" with:
      """
      source 'http://custom.com'
      gem 'special'
      """
    When I run "bddgen yard"
    Then the file "Gemfile" should contain exactly:
      """
      source 'http://custom.com'
      gem 'special'
      gem 'yard'
      
      """
    And the exit status should be 0
  
  Scenario: Run `bddgen yard` in a project with an existing Rakefile
    Given a file named "Rakefile" with:
      """
      require 'custom'
      require 'special'
      """
    When I run "bddgen yard"
    Then the file "Rakefile" should contain "require 'custom'"
    And the file "Rakefile" should contain "require 'special'"
    And the file "Rakefile" should contain the yard task
    And the exit status should be 0
